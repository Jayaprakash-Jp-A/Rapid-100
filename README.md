🚨 RAPID-X
AI-Powered Emergency Intelligence & Orchestration Platform

RAPID-X is an advanced AI-driven Emergency Command & Control simulation platform designed to enhance real-time emergency response systems.

It integrates speech intelligence, emotion analysis, priority scoring, department routing, live tracking, and operational dashboards into a unified emergency intelligence ecosystem.

🌍 Vision

To transform traditional emergency call centers into intelligent, data-driven, predictive command systems that:

Reduce response time

Improve prioritization accuracy

Enhance inter-department coordination

Increase operational transparency

Enable predictive public safety planning
